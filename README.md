# MVOSLab ChatBot
 South Dakota State University's MVOS Lab's Chatbot based on DeepSeek-R1
 # Download Ollama using the following link depending upon your OS type.
 https://github.com/ollama/ollama
 # Assuming you are on Windows platform, open command window and then download the DeepSeek-R1 model of your choice.
 # This will depend on the compute capacity of your computer/laptop. The Deepseek-R1:7b was tested on a laptop with NVIDIA RTX 4070.
 # Get to the path where ollama was downloaded and once there, type the following command.
 ollama run deepseek-r1:7b
 # This will first download the model's weights and the necessary files and then run it locally using an API on localhost at port#11434
 # You should be able to interact with the Deepseek-R1:7b model locally. The inference time will depend upon your local machine's compute capacity.
 # Alternatively, download the executable file "mvos_chatbot_v4.exe" and run it by double clicking the downloaded file. Make sure to download...
 # ..all the PNG files and put them in the same directory where your ".exe" file exists.
